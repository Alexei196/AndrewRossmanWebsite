            <p>I am a currently enrolled Computer Science graduate student at San Diego State University. My life's goal is to make a butload of money; Like a metric fuckton. I'm talking enough to stuff my mattress with 100s with plenty leftover. I'm talking Scrooge McDuck diving into a vat of stacked paper. I plan on making so much money the whole world will look at my Citi bank account and go "holy shit." I am also a fan of cats.</p>
